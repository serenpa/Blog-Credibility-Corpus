3	253	3	Windows Terminal Services We regularly use two pieces of software to access Windows computers remotely.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4	253	4	"Windows Terminal Services from Microsoft (now called “Remote Desktop” in Windows XP, and also marketed by Citrix) is one of them; the other is WinVNC which is an open source project that originated at AT&T in Cambridge, England."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5	253	5	"If you have a choice in the matter, Windows Terminal Services is much, much better, for two reasons."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

22	253	22	"The two most common cases I’ve found are when you right-click to get a popup menu — the menu appears on the server but is not transmitted to the client so you think something is wrong — and when you scroll in an application that uses smooth scrolling, the screen gets all messed up."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

1016	685	94	"Such a complete spec is just as hard to write as the underlying computer program, because just as many details have to be answered by spec writer as the programmer."	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1017	685	95	To use terminology from information theory: the spec needs just as many bits of Shannon entropy as the computer program itself would have.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1018	685	96	Each bit of entropy is a decision taken by the spec-writer or the programmer.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1019	685	97	"So, the bottom line is that if there really were a mechanical way to prove things about the correctness of a program, all you’d be able to prove is whether that program is identical to some other program that must contain the same amount of entropy as the first program, otherwise some of the behaviors are going to be undefined, and thus unproven."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1020	685	98	"So now the spec writing is just as hard as writing a program, and all you’ve done is moved one problem from over here to over there, and accomplished nothing whatsoever."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

1024	685	102	"The old testers at Microsoft checked lots of things: they checked if fonts were consistent and legible, they checked that the location of controls on dialog boxes was reasonable and neatly aligned, they checked whether the screen flickered when you did things, they looked at how the UI flowed, they considered how easy the software was to use, how consistent the wording was, they worried about performance, they checked the spelling and grammar of all the error messages, and they spent a lot of time making sure that the user interface was consistent from one part of the product to another, because a consistent user interface is easier to use than an inconsistent one."	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

3900	921	11	Let’s look at some of the differences between these models.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3901	921	12	"The first thing to ask is: are you going into a business that has competition, or not?"	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3902	921	13	"Ben and Jerry’s Amazon   Lots of established competitors New technology, no competition at first     If you don’t have any real competition, like Amazon, there is a chance that you can succeed at a “land grab”, that is, get as many customers as quickly as possible, so that later competitors will have a serious barrier to entry."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3903	921	14	"But if you’re going into an industry where there is already a well-established set of competitors, the land-grab idea doesn’t make sense."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3904	921	15	You need to create your customer base by getting customers to switch over from competitors. 	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3905	921	16	"In general, venture capitalists aren’t too enthusiastic about the idea of going into a market with pesky competitors."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3906	921	17	"Personally, I’m not so scared of established competition; perhaps because I worked on Microsoft Excel during a period when it almost completely took over Lotus 123, which virtually had the market to themselves."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
3907	921	18	"The number one word processor, Word, displaced WordPerfect, which displaced WordStar, all of which had been near monopolies at one time or another."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3908	921	19	"And Ben and Jerry’s grew to be a fabulous business, even though it’s not like you couldn’t get ice cream before they came along."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3909	921	20	"It’s not impossible to displace a competitor, if that’s what you want to do."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3910	921	21	(I’ll talk about how to do that in a future Strategy Letter).	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3911	921	22	"Another question about displacing competitors has to do with network effects and lock-in:      Ben and Jerry’s Amazon   No network effect; weak customer lock-in Strong network effect, strong customer lock-in     A “network effect” is a situation where the more customers you have, the more customers you will get."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3912	921	23	It’s based on Metcalfe’s Law: the value of a network is equal to the number of users squared.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3913	921	24	A good example is eBay.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3914	921	25	"If you want to sell your old Patek Philippe watch, you’re going to get a better price on eBay, because there are more buyers there."	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

3920	921	31	“Lock-in” is where there is something about the business that makes people not want to switch.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3921	921	32	"Nobody wants to switch their Internet provider, even if the service isn’t very good, because of the hassle of changing your email address and notifying everyone of the new email address."	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3922	921	33	People don’t want to switch word processors if their old files can’t be read by the new word processor.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3923	921	34	Even better than lock-in is the sneaky version I call stealth lock-in: services which lock you in without your even realizing it.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

3927	921	38	The sheer chore of doing this is likely to prevent you from switching away from PayMyBills.com — better just to let them keep sucking $8.95 out of your bank account every month.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

3936	921	47	"While I was working at Juno, management just failed to understand this point, and they missed their best opportunity to overtake AOL during a land rush when everyone was coming online: they didn’t spend strongly enough on customer acquisition because they didn’t want to dilute existing shareholders by raising more capital, and they didn’t think strategically about chat and IM, so they never developed any software features to provide the kind of stealth lock-in that AOL has."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

4703	948	119	"That means that if you’re competing for space with another potential tenant, and that tenant has his own broker and you don’t, then the landlord’s broker is going to like you much more… twice as much, in fact."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

5783	1003	62	What it depends on is only one thing: what are the interest rates on that day in the future.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5784	1003	63	Here’s why.	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5785	1003	64	Lets say interest rates go down.	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5786	1003	65	"So in ten years, the interest rate goes down below 4.75%."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5787	1003	66	"In that case, the government is going to pay you back on the spot, because they can borrow the same money somewhere else for cheaper."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5788	1003	67	"For example, if the interest rate in ten years is only 4%, the government can save $750 a year by borrowing elsewhere and paying off your loan, so they’d be crazy not to do it."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5789	1003	68	But what if interest rates go up?	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5790	1003	69	"In that case, the government is not going to pay you back, even if they have extra money burning a hole in their government pockets!"	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5791	1003	70	"If they don’t need the money, they can just loan it to someone else."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5792	1003	71	"For example, if the interest rates in ten years are 6%, then the government can loan your $100,000 to someone else at 6%, making $6000 a year, and paying you your $4750 a year, and they’re making a $1250 profit which they can use to give tax refunds to rich Texasshire oilmen and bomb third world countries, or whatever they want to do."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5793	1003	72	But the important point is:  If rates go down they will prepay.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

6349	248	1	Feedback from my posting about FogBUGZ Setup fell into four categories.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6350	248	2	“Why make Setup reversable?	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
6351	248	3	Instead you should collect all the information from the user and make all the changes in one batch at the end.”	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
6352	248	4	There are a couple of things to understand here.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6353	248	5	"First of all, even if you do everything in one batch at the end, there’s always a possibility that some step in the middle of the batch will fail, and in that case, a well-behaved setup program will back out the steps that were already done."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6354	248	6	There are well over 100 error messages in the string table for FogBUGZ Setup so the number of things that can fail is not insignificant.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6355	248	7	"Second, it’s not nice to tell people about an error in their input three pages after they made the mistake."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6356	248	8	"For example, early in the FogBUGZ setup process we prompt you to create an account for FogBUGZ to use:  The account creation could fail for a myriad of reasons, none of which can be predicted before trying to create the account."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6357	248	9	"For example, the password might not conform to the system password policy."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6358	248	10	And different national versions of Windows NT have different rules about accented letters in passwords (betcha didn’t know that!).	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6359	248	11	"It’s better to tell the user about this problem right away so they can correct their input rather than having a message come up during the long install process later, forcing the user to back up and fix it."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6360	248	12	"And even if you force the user to back up and fix it, you still have to undo the first part of the work that you did before creating the account, otherwise you’ve left their system in an indeterminate state."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6361	248	13	In any case I need to write code to create the account and delete the account in case something later fails; I might as well call that code on this page of the wizard where I can display a useful error message.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6362	248	14	And what are the kinds of things that need to be reversable?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6363	248	15	"Well, in order to upgrade FogBUGZ without requiring a reboot (and we never, ever require a reboot), we have to shut down a couple of processes that might have been keeping FogBUGZ files pinned down, such as IIS (Microsoft’s web server)."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
6364	248	16	So part one of the batch is “Stop IIS.”	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

6366	248	18	"And anyway, it’s not like I don’t need to write the code for “Start IIS” for the end of the batch."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6367	248	19	So the code to rollback “Stop IIS” is already written.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

11464	862	15	"Almost everything they find is either obvious or has been done before, so it shouldn’t be patentable, but they use some sneaky tricks to get these things through the patent office."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
11465	862	16	The first technique is to try to make the language of the patent as confusing and obfuscated as possible.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
11466	862	17	That actually makes it harder for a patent examiner to identify prior art or evaluate if the invention is obvious.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

11470	862	21	"The harder the patent is to read, the more likely it will be inadvertently infringed."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
11471	862	22	The second technique to getting bad software patents issued is to use a thesaurus.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

11474	862	25	They have to; no single patent examiner can possibly be aware of more than (rounding to nearest whole number) 0% of the prior art which might have invalidated the application.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
11475	862	26	"Since patent examiners rely so much on keyword searches, when you submit your application, if you can change some of the keywords in your patent to be different than the words used everywhere else, you might get your patent through even when there’s blatant prior art, because by using weird, made-up words for things, you’ve made that prior art harder to find. "	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

14131	897	32	Although the developers have the luxury of (at least) some control over the “deployment” environment — the computers in the data center — they have to deal with a wide variety of web browsers and a large number of users so I consider this basically a variation of shrinkwrap.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

18596	964	47	"For example, you might get 1 Mbps of bandwidth capped, and you can use all of it or none of it and pay the same amount."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

19945	996	38	Let me finish describing our strategy.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
19946	996	39	First problem: we don’t know enough about .NET to write good code.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
19947	996	40	"As usual in any development environment there are many ways to do any given thing, and we haven’t quite learned the first way, let alone the second way."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
19948	996	41	So the quality of .NET code that we can write is not good enough to ship.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
19949	996	42	"Until Bill Vaughn’s first ADO book came out, we didn’t even know the optimal ways to do basic SQL queries."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
19950	996	43	"So our first priority is education, which we will accomplish by doing all future in-house and web-based development in .NET — basically, all the software that nobody is paying money for."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
19951	996	44	We can migrate parts of the Fog Shop to .NET and certainly use .NET for all kinds of internal stuff.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
19952	996	45	(Today I wrote a FogShop Coupon Generator in ASP.NET.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
19953	996	46	It’s kind of messy but it works!)	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
19954	996	47	Second problem: the obese 20 MB CLR (runtime).	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
19955	996	48	It’s bad enough that about 6 MB of the 8 MB CityDesk download comes from runtimes and data access libraries; we just can’t expect every home CityDesk Starter Edition user to download another 20 MB.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
19956	996	49	The hope is that in a year or two or three lots of people will have the CLR from somewhere else (too bad it didn’t make it into Windows XP).	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
19957	996	50	"We’ll keep an eye on that; it used to change your user agent; I hope it still does, so we can get statistics."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
19958	996	51	The bottom line is that neither CityDesk nor FogBUGZ can be ported to .NET today.	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
19959	996	52	We will port some future version of CityDesk when the CLR has about 75% penetration.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
19960	996	53	"The plan is to:  port existing code and forms using Microsoft’s conversion tools  fix problems by brute force until it’s working again  create new forms and classes using C#  gradually port old forms and classes to C# whenever they need major work, anyway  many old forms and classes will remain in VB.NET forever (using the ugly backwards compatibility string functions, etc.) as long as they work properly."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
19961	996	54	FogBUGZ also needs to wait for greater CLR penetration on server computers; we need to survey our customers and find out how bad it would be if FogBUGZ required the CLR.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
19962	996	55	We have another product in the works which we haven’t talked about publically; this one will share a large portion of its code base with FogBUGZ (a subset we are going to name “Dispatcho”) so it will remain VBScript/ASP at heart until we port FogBUGZ.	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
19963	996	56	"For FogBUGZ/Dispatcho/SecretNewProduct, the plan is:  wait until it’s OK to require CLR,  port existing “business logic” classes to C#,  keep current web forms in ASP,  and create new web forms in ASP.NET."	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
